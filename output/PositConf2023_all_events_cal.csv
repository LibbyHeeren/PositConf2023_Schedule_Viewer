Talk - How to Win Friends and Influence People (With Data),09/19/2023,15:40:00,09/19/2023,16:00:00,False,"Speaker: Joe Powers; Abstract: Too many great data science products never go into production. To persuade leaders and colleagues to adopt your data science offering, you must translate your insights into terms that are relevant and accessible to them. Attempts to persuade these audiences with proofs and model performance stats will often fall flat because the audience is left feeling overwhelmed. 

This talk will demonstrate the data simulation, visualization, and story-telling techniques that I use to influence leadership and the community-building techniques I use to earn the trust and support of fellow analysts. These efforts were successful in persuading Intuit to adopt advanced analytic methods like sequential analysis that cut the duration of our AB tests by over 60%.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - Package Management for Data Scientists,09/19/2023,15:40:00,09/19/2023,16:00:00,False,"Speaker: Tyler Finethy; Abstract: In my talk, ""Package Management for Data Scientists,"" we will discuss software dependencies for R and Python and the common issues faced during package installations. I will begin with an overview of package management, highlighting its crucial role in data science. We'll then focus on practical strategies to prevent dependency errors and address effective troubleshooting when these problems occur. Lastly, we will look towards the future, discussing potential package management improvements, focusing on reproducibility and accessibility for those new to the field.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - The Road to Easier Shiny App Deployments,09/19/2023,15:40:00,09/19/2023,16:00:00,False,"Speaker: Liam Kalita; Abstract: We're often helping developers to assess, fix and improve their Shiny apps, and often the first thing we do is see if we can deploy the app. If you can't deploy your Shiny app, it's a waste of time. If you can deploy it successfully, then at the very least it runs, so we've got something to work with. 

There are a bunch of reasons why apps fail to deploy. They can be easy to fix, like Hardcoded secrets, fonts, or missing libraries. Or they can be intractable and super frustrating to deal with, like manifest mismatches, resource starvation, and missing libraries. 

At the end of this talk, I want you to know how to identify, investigate and proactively prevent Shiny app deployment failures from happening.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - dbtplyr: Bringing Column-Name Contracts from R to dbt,09/19/2023,16:20:00,09/19/2023,16:40:00,False,"Speaker: Emily Riederer; Abstract: dplyr's select helpers exemplify how the tidyverse uses opinionated design to push users into the pit of success. The ability to efficiently operate on names incentivizes good naming patterns and creates efficiency in data wrangling and validation.

However, in a polyglot world, users may find they must leave the pit when comparable syntactic sugar is not accessible in other languages like Python and SQL. 

In this talk, I will explain how dplyr's select helpers inspired my approach to 'column name contracts,' how good naming systems can help supercharge data management with packages like {dplyr} and {pointblank}, and my experience building the {dbtplyr} to port this functionality to dbt for building complex SQL-based data pipelines.",Grand Ballroom CD
Talk - Teaching Data Science in Adverse Circumstances: Posit Cloud and Quarto to the Rescue,09/19/2023,16:20:00,09/19/2023,16:40:00,False,"Speaker: Aleksander Dietrichson; Abstract: The focus of this presentation is on the challenges faced by teachers of data science whose students are not quantitatively inclined and may face some adversity in terms of technology resources available to them and potential language barriers. I identify three main areas of challenges and show how at Universidad Nacional de San Martín (Argentina) we addressed each of the areas through a combination of original curriculum redesign, production of course materials appropriate for the students in question; and the use of OS, and some Posit products, i.e.:posit.cloud and Quarto. I show how these technologies can be used as a pedagogical tool to overcome the challenges mentioned, even on a shoestring budget.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - What an Early 2000s Reality Show Taught Me about File Management,09/19/2023,16:20:00,09/19/2023,16:40:00,False,"Speaker: Reiko Okamoto; Abstract: Ideas from home organization shows are surprisingly applicable to file management. Using a room divider to establish dedicated zones for different activities in a studio apartment is analogous to creating self-contained projects in RStudio. Likewise, swapping mismatched hangers with matching ones to tidy a closet resembles the adoption of a file naming convention to make a directory easier to navigate. 

In this talk, I will share good practices in file management through the lens of home organization. We all know that clutter, whether it is in our physical space or on our machine, destroys our ability to focus. These practices will help R users of all levels create a serene, relaxing environment where they feel inspired to work with data.",Grand Ballroom A

Does it make your skin crawl to hear ""the data speaks for itself, don't waste your time making that deliverable 'pretty'""? 

As a compliment to the many sessions this week in which you'll hear great methods for *how* to make your work more beautiful, in this talk, we'll walk through some of the scientific research that shows *why* taking the time to make design improvements is critical to communicating your point with data—for dashboards, reports, and even simple tables.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - Adding a Touch of glitr: Developing a Package of Themes on Top of ggplot,09/19/2023,16:40:00,09/19/2023,17:00:00,False,"Speaker: Aaron Chafetz & Karishma Srikanth; Abstract: How do you create brand cohesion across your large team when it comes to data viz? My colleague and I, inspired by the BBC's bbplot, developed a package on top of ggplot2 to create a common look and feel for our team's products. This effort improved not just the cohesiveness of our work, but also trustworthiness. By creating this package, we reduced the reliance on using defaults and the time spent on each project customizing numerous graphic elements. More importantly, this package provided an easier on-ramp for new teammates to adopt R. We would like to share our journey within a federal agency developing a style guide, to guide and inspire other organizations who could benefit from developing their own branding package and guidance.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - Getting the Most Out of Git,09/19/2023,16:40:00,09/19/2023,17:00:00,False,"Speaker: Colin Gillespie; Abstract: Did you believe that Git will solve all of your data science worries? Instead, you've been plunged HEAD~1 first into merging (or is that rebasing?) chaos. Issues are ignored, branches are everywhere, main never works, and no one really knows who owns the repository. 

Don't worry! There are ways to escape this pit of despair. Over the last few years, we've worked with many data science teams. During this time, we've spotted common patterns and also common pitfalls. While one size does not fit all, there are golden rules that should be followed. At the end of this talk, you'll understand the processes other data science teams implement to make Git work for them.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - In-Process Analytical Data Management with DuckDB,09/19/2023,16:40:00,09/19/2023,17:00:00,False,"Speaker: Hannes Mühleisen; Abstract: DuckDB is an in-process analytical data management system. DuckDB supports complex SQL queries, has no external dependencies, and is deeply integrated into the R ecosystem. For example, DuckDB can run SQL queries directly on R data frames without any data transfer. 

DuckDB is free and open source software under the MIT license. DuckDB uses state-of-the-art query processing techniques like vectorized execution and automatic parallelism. DuckDB is out-of-core capable, meaning that it is possible to process datasets far bigger than main memory. 

In our talk, we will describe the user values of DuckDB, and how it can be used to improve their day-to-day lives through automatic parallelization, efficient operators, and out-of-core operations.",Grand Ballroom CD
Talk - You Can Lead a Horse to Water . . . Changing the Data Science Culture for Veterinary Scientists,09/19/2023,16:40:00,09/19/2023,17:00:00,False,"Speaker: Jill MacKay; Abstract: In education research, knowledge recall is often considered the easiest aspect of learning, and the creation of new knowledge is the most challenging. Skill development therefore often requires learners to consistently 'do' the skill and receive feedback from experts to allow them to fully enter a new culture of practice. This is particularly challenging for those who are interdisciplinary and have limited control over their workload, such as medics and field scientists. In this talk, an educational scientist describes the previous 10 years of supporting veterinary scientists to adopt open science practices surrounding data science. What worked, what failed miserably, and reflections on why it can be so hard to get a horse to drink.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - Documenting Things: Openly for Future Us,09/19/2023,17:00:00,09/19/2023,17:20:00,False,"Speaker: Julia Stewart Lowndes; Abstract: RMarkdown and Quarto are shifting the paradigm for how professionals learn to code, write documentation, and teach others. I'll showcase the style I first experienced through learning from Jenny Bryan (Stat545, Happy Git With R, What They Forgot to Teach You About R): narrative and code together, shared openly as a website, that builds trust with learners and provides a resource to consult during and outside of live-teaching. This mode shifts culture in a powerful way since we can fork this idea, and repeat it in our own work. I'll share examples of how professional researchers are using this style to write open documentation, from technical workflows to community onboarding. I'll also highlight design elements for writing open documentation and tips for doing so with Quarto.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - duckplyr: Tight Integration of duckdb with R and the tidyverse,09/19/2023,17:00:00,09/19/2023,17:20:00,False,"Speaker: Kirill Müller; Abstract: duckdb is an analytical database system that works great with R and Python and other host systems. dplyr is the grammar of data manipulation in the tidyverse, tightly integrated with R, but it works best for small or medium-sized data. The former has been designed with large or big data in mind, but currently, you need to formulate your queries in SQL.

The new duckplyr package offers the best of both worlds. It transforms a dplyr pipe into a query object that duckdb can execute, using an optimized query plan. It is better than dbplyr because the interface is ""data frames in, data frames out"", and no SQL code is generated.

The talk first presents our results, a bit of the mechanics, and an outlook for this ambitious project.",Grand Ballroom CD
Talk - HTML and CSS for R Users,09/19/2023,17:00:00,09/19/2023,17:20:00,False,"Speaker: Albert Rapp; Abstract: It's easy to think that R users do not need HTML and CSS. After all, R is a language designed for data analysis, right? But the reality is that these web standards are everywhere, even in R. In fact, many great tools like {ggtext}, {gt}, {shiny}, and Quarto unlock their full potential when you know a little bit of HTML & CSS. In this talk, I will demonstrate specific examples where R users can benefit from HTML and CSS and show you how to get started with these two languages.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - Visualizing Data Analysis Pipelines with Pandas Tutor and Tidy Data Tutor,09/19/2023,17:00:00,09/19/2023,17:20:00,False,"Speaker: Sean Kross; Abstract: The data frame is a fundamental data structure for data scientists using Python and R. Pandas and the tidyverse are designed to center building pipelines for the transformation of data frames. However, within these pipelines it is not always clear how each operation is changing the underlying data frame. To explain each step in a pipeline data science instructors resort to hand-drawing diagrams to illustrate the semantics of operations such as filtering, sorting, and grouping. 

In this talk, I will introduce Pandas Tutor and Tidy Data Tutor, step-by-step visual representation engines of data frame transformations. Both tools illustrate the row, column, and cell-wise relationships between an operation's input and output data frames.",Grand Ballroom B

Talk - Siuba and duckdb: Analyzing Everything Everywhere All at Once,09/19/2023,17:20:00,09/19/2023,17:40:00,False,"Speaker: Michael Chow; Abstract: Every data analysis in Python starts with a big fork in the road: which DataFrame library should I use?

The DataFrame Decision locks you into different methods, with subtly different behavior::

different table methods (e.g. polars `.with_columns()` vs pandas `.assign()`)
different column methods (e.g. polars `.map_dict()` vs pandas `.map()`)

In this talk, I'll discuss how siuba (a dplyr port to python) combines with duckdb (a crazy powerful sql engine) to provide a unified, dplyr-like interface for analyzing a wide range of data sources—whether pandas and polars DataFrames, parquet files in a cloud bucket, or pins on Posit Connect.

Finally, I'll discuss recent experiments to more tightly integrate siuba and duckdb.",Grand Ballroom CD

Keynote - It's Abstractions All the Way Down ...,09/20/2023,10:30:00,09/20/2023,11:30:00,False,"Speaker: JD Long; Abstract: Over 20 years ago Joel Spolsky famously wrote, ""All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky."" Unsurprisingly this has not changed. However, we have introduced more and more layers of abstraction into our workflows: Virtual Machines, AWS services, WASM, Docker, R, Python, data frames, and on and on. But then on top of the computational abstractions we have people abstractions: managers, colleagues, executives, stakeholders, etc. 

JD's presentation will be a wild romp through the mental models of abstractions and discuss how we, as technical analytical types, can gain skill in traversing abstractions and dealing with leaks.",Grand Ballroom
Talk - Data Science in Production: The Way to a Centralized Infrastructure,09/20/2023,13:00:00,09/20/2023,13:20:00,False,"Speaker: Oliver Bracht; Abstract: In this talk, the success story of Covestro's posit infrastructure is presented. The problem of the leading German material manufacturer was that no common development environment existed. With the help of eoda and Posit, a replicable, centralized development environment for R and Python was created. Although R and Python represent the core of the infrastructure, multiple languages and tools are unified. In addition to the collaboration of Covestro's data science teams, compliance guidelines could also be better fulfilled. The staging architecture hereby provides developers with a concept for testing and going live with their products. This project presents a best practice approach to a data science infrastructure using Covestro as an example.",Grand Ballroom B

As of March 2023, there were over 19,000 packages available on CRAN. Hadley Wickham and I recently updated the R Packages book for a second edition, which brought home just how much the package development landscape has changed in recent years (for the better!). 

In this talk, I highlight recent-ish developments that I think have a great payoff for package maintainers. I'll talk about the impact of new services like GitHub Actions, new tools like pkgdown, and emerging shared practices, such as principles that are helpful when testing a package.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - Sustainable Growth of Global Communities: R-Ladies' Next Ten Years,09/20/2023,14:40:00,09/20/2023,15:00:00,False,"Speaker: Riva Quiroga; Abstract: R-Ladies' first ten years were about growing the community: from being just one chapter in 2012 to becoming a global organization in 2016, and now fostering more than 200 chapters worldwide. But how can we face the challenges of growing an organization based solely on volunteer work?

In this talk, we discuss how we are planning the development of R-Ladies for the next ten years, focusing on the sustainable management of an ever-growing community. To that end, we will present our most recent efforts at documenting workflows, making data-driven decisions, and automating tasks that allow volunteers to focus their time where it is most needed. Attendees will take away ideas on how to support volunteers in their own community or project, and on how to use GitHub Actions to automate workflows and tasks.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - We Converted our Documentation to Quarto,09/20/2023,14:40:00,09/20/2023,15:00:00,False,"Speaker: Melissa Van Bussel; Abstract: ""Wiki"", ""User Guide"", ""Handbook"" -- whatever you call yours, we converted ours to Quarto!

A year ago, my team's documentation, which had been created using Microsoft Word, was large and lacked version control. Scrolling through the document was slow, and, due to confidentiality reasons, only one person could edit it at a time, which was a significant challenge for our team of multiple developers. After realizing we needed a more flexible solution, we successfully converted our documentation to Quarto. 

In this talk, I'll discuss our journey converting to Quarto, the challenges we faced along the way, and tips and tricks for anyone else who might be looking to adopt Quarto too.

Talk - Becoming an R Package Author (or How I Got Rich* Responding to GitHub Issues),09/20/2023,15:00:00,09/20/2023,15:20:00,False,"Speaker: Matt Herman; Abstract: The transition from analyzing data in R to making packages in R can feel like a big step. Writing code to clean data or make visualizations seems categorically different from building robust ""software"" on which other people rely. 

In this talk, I'll show why that distinction is not necessarily true by discussing my personal experience from learning R in graduate school to reporting bugs on GitHub to becoming a co-author of the tidycensus package and a practicing data scientist. The positive and supportive R community on GitHub, Twitter, and elsewhere contributes to why anyone who writes R code can become a package author.

* I have not actually gotten rich but I did get freelance data work based on my package contributions!",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - Extending Quarto,09/20/2023,15:00:00,09/20/2023,15:20:00,False,"Speaker: Richard Iannone; Abstract: What are Quarto shortcode extensions? Think of them as powerful little programs you can run in your Quarto docs. I won't show you how to build a shortcode extension during this talk but rather I'm going to take you on a trip across this new ecosystem of shortcode extensions that people have already written. For example, I'll introduce you to the `fancy-text` extension for outputting nicely-formatted versions of fancy strings such as LaTeX and BibTeX; you'll learn all about the `fontawesome`, `lordicon`, `academicons`, `material-icons`, and `bsicons` shortcode extensions that let you add all sorts of icons. This is only a sampling of the shortcode extensions I will present, there will be many other inspiring examples as well.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - Grammar of Graphics in Python with Plotnine,09/20/2023,15:00:00,09/20/2023,15:20:00,False,"Speaker: Hassan Kibirige; Abstract: 
ggplot2 is one of the most loved visualisation libraries. It implements a Grammar of Graphics system, which requires one to think about data in terms of columns of variables and how to transform them into geometric objects. It is elegant and powerful. This is a talk about plotnine, which brings the elegance of ggplot2 to the Python programming language. It is an invitation to learn about the Grammar of Graphics system and to appreciate it.

Talk - How to Keep Your Data Science Meetup Sustainable,09/20/2023,15:00:00,09/20/2023,15:20:00,False,"Speaker: Ted Laderas; Abstract: Many data science meetup organizers struggle with burnout. It can be daunting to plan a meetup schedule, especially with the added burden of work and life.
In this talk, I want to highlight some strategies for keeping your data science meetup sustainable. Specifically, I want to highlight the role of self-care in growing and sustaining your group, as well as low-key activities like a data scavenger hunt, watching videos together, styling plots together, and sharing useful tidyverse functions. 

By making it easy for your members to contribute and empowering them, it takes a lot of the burden off you as an organizer. You don't need to reinvent the wheel for meetups or have famous guests for each one. Let's start the conversation and make your meetup last.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - Committing to Change: How to Increase Accessibility in Your Favorite Open Source Projects,09/20/2023,15:20:00,09/20/2023,15:40:00,False,"Speaker: Rose Franzen; Abstract: When people hear the phrase ""technology accessibility,"" their minds often jump to accessibility for end-users, skipping past accessibility for developers or data scientists. While companies that provide solutions for data scientists are starting to roll out accessibility updates, data scientists also rely upon and contribute to a wide variety of small, open source projects which do not have the resources to bring in accessibility experts. This talk weaves together disability theory, principles of inclusive design, and common open source project structures to discuss simple adjustments that can be made by folks of all levels of tech expertise to decrease barriers to contributions by neurodiverse and disabled community members.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - Diversify Your Career with Shiny for Python,09/20/2023,15:20:00,09/20/2023,15:40:00,False,"Speaker: Gordon Shotwell; Abstract: A few years ago my company made a sudden shift from R to Python which was quite bad for my career because I didn't really know Python. The main issue was that I couldn't find a niche that allowed me to use my existing knowledge while learning the new language. 

Shiny for Python is a great niche for R users because none of the Python web frameworks can do what Shiny can do. Additionally, almost all of your knowledge of the R package is applicable to the Python one. 

This talk will provide an overview of the Python web application landscape and articulate what Shiny adds to this landscape, and then go through the five things that R users need to know before developing their first Shiny for Python application.",Grand Ballroom CD
Talk - Never again in outer par mode: making next-generation PDFs with Quarto and `typst`,09/20/2023,15:20:00,09/20/2023,15:40:00,False,"Speaker: Carlos Scheidegger; Abstract: Quarto 1.4 will introduce support for Typst. Typst is a brand-new open-source typesetting system built from scratch to support the lessons we have learned over almost half a century of high-quality computer typesetting that TeX and LaTeX have enabled.  If you've ever had to produce a PDF with Quarto and got stuck handling an inscrutable error message from LaTeX, or wanted to create a new template but were too intimated by LaTeX's arcane syntax, this talk is for you. I'll show you why we need an alternative for TeX and LaTeX , and why it will make Quarto even better.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - Side Effects of a Year of Blogging,09/20/2023,15:20:00,09/20/2023,15:40:00,False,"Speaker: Millie Symns; Abstract: A big part of being in the R community is sharing your knowledge in different forums, no matter how big or small. So what better way to do that than a blog? And what better way than using R and Posit products to build and maintain that blog and website? This was the route I took to challenge myself in putting myself out there more in the community to find my voice, share my knowledge and learn new things. 

In this talk, I will reflect on lessons learned and gains I have spent the past year blogging and sharing my website for all to see. The side effects include professional and personal benefits - from a clear profile of my skills to the progression of the development of my art. You may leave inspired to try the challenge for yourself.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - Black Hair and Data Science Have More in Common Than You Think,09/20/2023,15:40:00,09/20/2023,16:00:00,False,"Speaker: Kari Jordan; Abstract: Data science is often difficult to define because of its many intersections, including statistics, programming, analytics, and other domain knowledge. Would you believe it if I told you Black hair and data science have much in common?

This talk is for those considering learning about, studying, or pursuing data science. In it, Dr. Kari L. Jordan draws parallels between approaches to caring for Black hair and approaches to learning data science. We start with the roots and end by picking the right tools and products to maintain our coiffure.",Grand Ballroom A

In my talk, I will share how a Biologist's mindset can make R package writing more approachable. This talk is an encouragement and a gentle stroll through the package building process. I will show you ways to be curious when you get stuck and how to prepare for the unexpected. I hope sharing my perspective will help others see package development as wonderful as the natural world and dispel any hesitation to start!",Grand Ballroom B
"Talk - Thanks, I Made It with Quartodoc",09/20/2023,15:40:00,09/20/2023,16:00:00,False,"Speaker: Isabel Zimmerman; Abstract: When Python package developers create documentation, they typically must choose between mostly auto-generated docs or writing all the docs by hand. This is problematic since effective documentation has a mix of function references, high-level context, examples, and other content. 

Quartodoc is a new documentation system that automatically generates Python function references within Quarto websites. This talk will discuss pkgdown's success in the R ecosystem and how those wins can be replicated in Python with quartodoc examples. Listeners will walk away knowing more about what makes documentation delightful (or painful), when to use quartodoc, and how to use this tool to make docs for a Python package.",Grand Ballroom CD
Talk - Unlock the Power of DataViz Animation and Interactivity in Quarto,09/20/2023,15:40:00,09/20/2023,16:00:00,False,"Speaker: Deepsha Menghani; Abstract: Data visualizations are a key tool in the process of sharing insights with stakeholders in ways that make an impact and are easily understood. Animation and interactivity bring in a key component of analysis that enables one to derive insights that a plot with two dimensions doesn't otherwise allow.  Sometimes it can tell a powerful story and sometimes it can just add some flair to an otherwise low-key story. This talk will showcase packages such as Plotly and Crosstalk that enable this creativity right within Quarto.

Plotly, Crosstalk, and Highcharter are powerful packages that allow interactivity right from within your Quarto markdown report, without the need to create an entire application. Easily have two separate plots interact with each other or add drill-down capabilities within a single plot, whichever adds to the story you are trying to tell.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - epoxy: Super Glue for Data-driven Reports and Shiny Apps,09/20/2023,16:20:00,09/20/2023,16:40:00,False,"Speaker: Garrick Aden-Buie; Abstract: R Markdown, Quarto, and Shiny are powerful frameworks that allow authors to create data-driven reports and apps. But truly excellent reports require a lot of work in the final steps to get numerical and stylistic formatting just right. 

{epoxy} is a new package that uses {glue} to give authors templating superpowers. Epoxy works in R Markdown and Quarto, in markdown, LaTeX, and HTML outputs. It also provides easy templating for Shiny apps for dynamic data-driven reporting. 

Beyond epoxy's features, this talk will also touch on tips and approaches for data-driven reporting that will be useful to a wide audience, from R Markdown experts to the Quarto and Shiny curious.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - Running R-Shiny without a Server,09/20/2023,16:20:00,09/20/2023,16:40:00,False,"Speaker: Joe Cheng; Abstract: A year ago, Posit announced ShinyLive, a deployment mode of Shiny that lets you run interactive applications written in Python, without actually running a Python server at runtime. Instead, ShinyLive turns Shiny for Python apps into pure client-side apps, running on a pure client-side Python installation.

Now, that same capability has come to Shiny for R, thanks to the webR project.

In this talk, I'll show you how you can get started with ShinyLive for R, and why this is more interesting than just cheaper app hosting. I'll talk about some of the different use cases we had in mind for ShinyLive, and help you decide if ShinyLive makes sense for your app.",Grand Ballroom CD
Talk - Scale Your Data Validation Workflow With {pointblank} and Posit Connect,09/20/2023,16:20:00,09/20/2023,16:40:00,False,"Speaker: Michael Garcia; Abstract: For the Data Services team at Medable, our number one priority is to ensure the data we collect and deliver to our clients is of the highest quality. The {pointblank} package, along with Posit Connect, modernizes how we tackle data validation within Data Services. 

In this talk, I will briefly summarize how we develop test code with {pointblank}, share with {pins}, execute with {rmarkdown}, and report findings with {blastula}. Finally, I will show how we aggregate data from test results across projects into a holistic view using {shiny}.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - Using Data to Protect Traditional Lifeways,09/20/2023,16:20:00,09/20/2023,16:40:00,False,"Speaker: Angie Reed; Abstract: The spirit of Penobscot Nation's work to protect the health of their relative, the Penobscot River, is embodied in the Penobscot water song which says ""Water, we love you, thank you so much water, we respect you."" Because the Penobscot River is not a natural resource - she is a relative, family - this song describes the foundation of our efforts to protect her health and well-being. The identity of Penobscot people cannot be disconnected from the river, and protecting this traditional lifeway is at the heart of our work. 
For over a decade we have used R to manage, transform, analyze, and visualize data, and the free, open-source Posit products help us leave a legacy of good data management and the ability to share results with Penobscot Nation citizens. You will learn more about how our use of R has helped us achieve more stringent protections for the Penobscot River and how we engage young people in every step of this work. We are also part of a larger network of tribal environmental professionals, working together to learn R and share data and insights.  We will give you information about how you can volunteer to help expand the network of folks providing technical assistance on any R and RStudio related topics.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - Can I Have a Word?,09/20/2023,16:40:00,09/20/2023,17:00:00,False,"Speaker: Ellis Hughes; Abstract: Since its release, {gt} has won over the hearts of many due to its flexible and powerful table-generating abilities. However, in cases where office products were required by downstream users, {gt}'s potential remained untapped. That all changed in 2022 when Rich Iannone and I collaborated to add Word documents as an official output type. Now, data scientists can engage stakeholders directly, wherever they are. 

Join me for an upcoming talk where I'll share my excitement about the new opportunities this update presents for the R community as well as future developments we can look forward to.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - Democratizing Access to Education Data,09/20/2023,16:40:00,09/20/2023,17:00:00,False,"Speaker: Erika Tyagi; Abstract: Every year, government agencies release large amounts of data on schools and colleges, but this information is scattered across various websites and is often difficult to use. To make these data more accessible, the Urban Institute built the Education Data Portal, a freely available one-stop shop for harmonized data and metadata for all major federal education datasets. We've also built tools around the portal including an R package, a (forthcoming) Python package, a Stata package, and an interface to generate R, Python, Stata, and JavaScript code. 

In this talk, we'll demonstrate how these tools work and share lessons we've learned about making data accessible to users with varying technical skills and preferred programming languages.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - Hitting the Target(s) of Data Orchestration,09/20/2023,16:40:00,09/20/2023,17:00:00,False,"Speaker: Alexandros Kouretsis; Abstract: We are living at a time when the size of datasets can be overwhelming. Add to this that their process involves linking together different computing systems and software, and integrating dynamically changing reference data, and for sure, you have a problem. Reproducibility, traceability, and transparency have left the building.

Here is where Posit Connect along with the vast R ecosystem comes to save the day, allowing the creation of reproducible pipelines. I will share with you my first-hand experience in this presentation. In particular, how we used Targets in Posit Connect combined with AWS technologies in a bioinformatics pipeline. The result? An effective and secure workflow orchestration that is scalable and advances knowledge.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - Magic with WebAssembly and webR,09/20/2023,16:40:00,09/20/2023,17:00:00,False,"Speaker: George Stagg; Abstract: Earlier this year the initial version of webR was released and users have begun building new interactive experiences with R on the web. In this talk, I'll discuss webR's TypeScript library and what it is able to do. The library allows users to interact with the R environment directly from JavaScript, which enables manipulation tricks that seem like magic. I'll begin by describing how to move objects from R to JS and back again, and discuss the technology that makes this possible. I'll continue with more advanced manipulation, such as invoking R functions from JS and talk about why you might want to do so. Finally, I'll describe how messages are sent over webR's communication channel and explain how this enables webR to work with Shinylive.",Grand Ballroom CD

Historically, content experts wrote in Word documents and data analysts used R for statistics and graphics. Specialization in different software tools created challenges for producing collaborative analytic reports, but Quarto has solved this problem. We will describe how we use Quarto for writing and editing text, embedding statistical analysis and graphics, and producing reports with a standard style in multiple formats, including web pages.",Grand Hall IJ
Talk - Take it in Bits: Using R to Make Eviction Data Accessible to the Legal Aid Community,09/20/2023,17:00:00,09/20/2023,17:20:00,False,"Speaker: Logan Pratico; Abstract: One in five low-income renter households in the US experienced falling behind on rent or being threatened with eviction in 2021. Yet most are unrepresented when facing eviction in court. The complex and fast-paced legal system obscures access to timely information, leaving tenants without assistance.

In this talk, I discuss the Civil Court Data Initiative's use of R alongside AWS Cloud and SQL to analyze disaggregate eviction records. I focus on the integration of RMarkdown with Amazon Athena and EC2 to create weekly eviction reports across 20 states for legal aid groups working to assist tenants. The upshot: accessible eviction data to help legal aid providers better address local legal needs.",Grand Ballroom A
Talk - Using R to develop production modeling workflows at Mayo Clinic,09/20/2023,17:00:00,09/20/2023,17:20:00,False,"Speaker: Brendan Broderick; Abstract: Developing workflows that help train models and also help deploy them can be a difficult task.   In this talk I will share some tools and workflow tips that I use to build production model pipelines using R. I will use a project of predicting patients who need specialized respiratory care after leaving the ICU as an example. I will show how to use the targets package to create a reproducible and easy to manage modeling and prediction pipeline, how to use the renv package to ensure a consistent environment for development and deployment, and how to use plumber, vetiver, and shiny applications to make the model accessible to care providers.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - Automating the Dutch National Flu Surveillance for Pandemic Preparedness,09/20/2023,17:20:00,09/20/2023,17:40:00,False,"Speaker: Patrick van den Berg; Abstract: The next pandemic may be caused by a flu strain, and with thousands of patients with the flu in Dutch hospitals annually it is important to have accurate and current data. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM) collects and processes flu data to achieve pandemic preparedness. However, the flu reporting process used to be very laborious, stealing precious time from epidemiologists. In our journey of automating this data pipeline we learned that collaboration was the most important factor in getting to a working system. This talk will be at the cross-section of data science and epidemiology and will provide you with a valuable opportunity to learn from our experiences.",Grand Ballroom B
Talk - Large Language Models in RStudio,09/20/2023,17:20:00,09/20/2023,17:40:00,False,"Speaker: James Wade; Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown the potential to transform how we code. As an R package developer, I have contributed to the creation of two packages -- gptstudio and gpttools -- specifically designed to incorporate LLMs into R workflows within the RStudio environment.
The integration of ChatGPT allows users to efficiently add code comments, debug scripts, and address complex coding challenges directly from RStudio. With text embedding and semantic search, we can teach ChatGPT new tricks, resulting in more precise and context-aware responses. This talk will delve into hands-on examples to showcase the practical application of these models, as well as offer my perspective as a recent entrant into public package development.",Grand Ballroom CD

Meals & Breaks - Databricks Lunch and Learn<br />Crossing Bridges: Reporting on NYC Taxi data with RStudio IDE and Databricks,09/20/2023,11:30:00,09/20/2023,13:00:00,False,"Speaker: NA; Abstract: *Due to limited seating, we do require you to pre-register for these by adding them to your schedule. Lunch will be served at the session.

Our passion as data enthusiasts lies in uncovering stories hidden within datasets. With RStudio IDE, we can explore insights with dplyr, create intricate graphs with ggplot2, and weave data narratives with Quarto. But what happens when we want to discover the stories within millions of rows of data? There comes a point when the sheer size of these datasets can overwhelm our local computer or even a single server node, leaving these stories seemingly out of reach.
Recently, Posit and Databricks announced a strategic partnership aimed at creating an unmatched experience when working with RStudio and Databricks. One initiative is enhanced support for Spark Connect in R via sparklyr. Now, it’s even easier for users to access Databricks clusters via Databricks Connect, allowing data enthusiasts to spend less time on configuration and data access and more time on generating insights and impactful reports.

Join this session to watch a demo to enable you to:
•Connect RStudio IDE to Databricks
•Discover your data with familiar tools
•Publish your content with Posit Connect or Databricks
See the new sparklyr experience and the seamless integration of Apache Spark, the tidyverse ecosystem and RStudio IDE.",Grand Hall KL
