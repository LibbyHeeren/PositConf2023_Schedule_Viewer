A night of trivia, where knowledge is crowned!"

Meals & Breaks,Databricks Lunch and Learn<br />Crossing Bridges: Reporting on NYC Taxi data with RStudio IDE and Databricks,"Wednesday, September 20",11:30 AM,01:00 PM,Grand Hall KL,"*Due to limited seating, we do require you to pre-register for these by adding them to your schedule. Lunch will be served at the session.

Our passion as data enthusiasts lies in uncovering stories hidden within datasets. With RStudio IDE, we can explore insights with dplyr, create intricate graphs with ggplot2, and weave data narratives with Quarto. But what happens when we want to discover the stories within millions of rows of data? There comes a point when the sheer size of these datasets can overwhelm our local computer or even a single server node, leaving these stories seemingly out of reach.
Recently, Posit and Databricks announced a strategic partnership aimed at creating an unmatched experience when working with RStudio and Databricks. One initiative is enhanced support for Spark Connect in R via sparklyr. Now, it’s even easier for users to access Databricks clusters via Databricks Connect, allowing data enthusiasts to spend less time on configuration and data access and more time on generating insights and impactful reports.

Join this session to watch a demo to enable you to:
•Connect RStudio IDE to Databricks
•Discover your data with familiar tools
•Publish your content with Posit Connect or Databricks
See the new sparklyr experience and the seamless integration of Apache Spark, the tidyverse ecosystem and RStudio IDE. "
